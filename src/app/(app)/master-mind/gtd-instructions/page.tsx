                           The goal of The Ogeemo Method (TOM) is to provide a single, trusted system to manage your commitments. By getting tasks and ideas out of your head and into Ogeemo, you free up your mind to focus on what's important: doing the work and having great ideas, not just holding onto them.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Projects, Tasks, and Calendar: How They Work Together</h3>
                        <p>
                           Ogeemo's productivity tools are deeply integrated. Understanding how they connect is the key to mastering your workflow.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Projects:</strong> A Project is any outcome that requires more than one step. This is your "YES" binâ€”a commitment to an outcome. You manage these high-level goals in the <Link href="/projects">Project Manager</Link>.
                            </li>
                             <li>
                                <strong>Tasks:</strong> Tasks are the individual, actionable steps that move a project forward. You manage the day-to-day work on a Kanban-style <strong>Task Board</strong> for each project.
                            </li>
                             <li>
                                <strong>Calendar:</strong> The Calendar provides a visual, time-based view of your scheduled tasks and events. Any task with a specific date and time will automatically appear here.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            <strong>The Magic of Integration:</strong> When you create a task in the <Link href="/time">Event Time Manager</Link> and link it to a project, it instantly appears on that project's Task Board and on your Calendar. Everything stays in sync automatically.
