# Objectives for the Action Manager "About" Panel

This document outlines the goals for the informational "About" panel on the `/action-manager` page.

## Core Requirements:

1.  **Initial Visibility:** The panel should be visible by default for new users to explain the purpose and functionality of the Action Manager.
2.  **Dismissible:** Users must have a clear and easy way to hide or dismiss the panel once they understand its content.
3.  **Toggleable:** There must be an intuitive and easily accessible control **directly on the Action Manager page** that allows the user to bring the panel back into view after it has been dismissed. A user should not have to navigate to a separate settings page to achieve this.

## Design & Content Principles:

-   **Clarity & Conciseness:** The content should quickly explain what the Action Manager is and how to use it.
-   **Intuitive Interaction:** The show/hide mechanism should be obvious and feel natural to the user.
-   **Clean UI:** The final implementation should not clutter the main workspace, especially for returning users who no longer need the information.
