                This is a cash-based accounting system, that starts out simple, but allows you to advance into more advanced accounting. The heart of BKS is the Three Ledgers, which is a complete record of all the money that comes into your business (income) and all the money that goes out (expenses). The General Ledger takes it's data from the income and expense ledgers. Or you can work strictly within the General Ledger.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
                By consistently recording your transactions, you will capture the essential information required for tax preparation and gain a clear picture of your business's financial health. You can view all transactions at once, or focus on just income or expenses using the tabs in the ledger view.
